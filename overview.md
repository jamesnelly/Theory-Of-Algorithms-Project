# Overview of Project

### Student Number: G00346996
### Student Name: James Nelly




## Introduction

**This is my introduction to the project. The assignment we were given to do was to write a program in C programming language that will
calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force.**

**In my respository you will find 2 folders MD5 folder which contains the code for the MD5 algorithm, I will go into more depth about the 
MD5 algorithm in another section. The second folder is SHA_256 in this folder its conatains various exmaples in the
C programming language on elements that we covered in our semester in theory of algorithms.**

**Also in my repository I have a document with some research that i did for the assignment also there is my readme.md 
where i will brifely explain the project and summarise  it.**
