## Introduction

**This is my introduction to the project. The assignment we were given to do was to write a program in C programming language that will
calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force.**

**In my respository you will find 2 folders MD5 folder which contains the code for the MD5 algorithm, I will go into more depth about the 
MD5 algorithm in another section. The second folder is SHA_256 in this folder its conatains various exmaples in the
C programming language on elements that we covered in our semester in theory of algorithms.**

**Also in my repository I have a document with some research that i did for the assignment also there is my readme.md 
where i will brifely explain the project and summarise  it.**

## Run
**To run the MD5 program you will have to follow these following steps that I have outlined. These commands will be inputed in to the command line**

- Step 1: You will have to cd into the Theory-Of-Algorithms-Project.

- Step 2: Then you will do the same with the MD5 folder cd into that.

- Step 3: Next you will have to compile the the program with this command. **"gcc -o md5 md5.c"**

- Step 4: To run the program from the command line you will have to enter this. **"./md5 (input argument)"**

- Step 5: There is a list of input arguments you can choose from

<br />
<br />


1. **The first argument is --help** 
This command when entered will output some useful information about the program and will give you insructions on the other arguments you can use.

<br />

2. **The second argument is --test**
 When you enter this command it will output five strings, which in turn will be hashed with the respective output underneath the string in hash format

3. **The Third argumnet is --input**
This command when entered will output some useful information about the program and will give you insructions on the other arguments you can use.
