## Introduction

**This is my introduction to the project. The assignment we were given to do was to write a program in C programming language that will
calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force.**

**In my respository you will find 2 folders MD5 folder which contains the code for the MD5 algorithm, I will go into more depth about the 
MD5 algorithm in another section. The second folder is SHA_256 in this folder its conatains various exmaples in the
C programming language on elements that we covered in our semester in theory of algorithms.**

**Also in my repository I have a document with some research that i did for the assignment also there is my readme.md 
where i will brifely explain the project and summarise  it.**

## Run
**To run the MD5 program you will have to follow these following steps that I have outlined. These commands will be inputed in to the command line**

- Step 1: You will have to cd into the Theory-Of-Algorithms-Project.

- Step 2: Then you will do the same with the MD5 folder cd into that.

- Step 3: Next you will have to compile the the program with this command. **"gcc -o md5 md5.c"**

- Step 4: To run the program from the command line you will have to enter this. **"./md5 (input argument)"**

- Step 5: There is a list of input arguments you can choose from

<br />
<br />


1. **The first argument is --help** 
This command when entered will output some useful information about the program and will give you insructions on the other arguments you can use.

<br />

2. **The second argument is --test**
 When you enter this command it will output five strings, which in turn will be hashed with the respective output underneath the string in hash format

3. **The Third argumnet is --input**
This command when entered will output some useful information about the program and will give you insructions on the other arguments you can use.

## Test

**To execute the tests its very simple and straight forward once you have compiled the program, you have to input --test in the command line, this argruments then calls the test method in the Main Method. for the test to work correctly I had to make an unsigned array of strings, which them loops over the size of the arrays and implements the hashing of each string and then outputs the MD5 hash value under the string in the output**
