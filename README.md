# MD5 digest algorithm 

## **The problem given**
***You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates
the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request
For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task
Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm
â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the
command line.***


## **what is the MD5 Algorithm ?**
***The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. 
Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, i
t has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, 
but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes***
